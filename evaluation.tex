\section{Experimental Evaluation}
In this section we experimentally evaluate  Crypt$\epsilon$  based on two parameters, the accuracy of the programs  which is measured  by reporting the expected error and the performance of Crypt$\epsilon$ programs measured via computation time. The Crypt$\epsilon$ programs considered for evaluations are the ones outlined in section \ref{program}. All the programs are compared with a competing implementation using state-of-the-art LDP techniques. 
\subsection{Accuracy}
\textit{Crypt$\epsilon$ Program 1}\\
Program 1 counts the number of records having age in range [50,60].  The competing LDP implementation uses the frequency oracle of \cite{LDP1}.
