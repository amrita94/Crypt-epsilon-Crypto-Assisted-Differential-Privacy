\stitle{Differential Privacy Cntd}\begin{theorem}(Sequential Composition). If $\mu_1$ and
$\mu_2$ are $\epsilon_1$-DP and $\epsilon_2$-DP algorithms that use independent randomness, then releasing the outputs $\mu_1(D)$ and
$\mu_2(D)$ on database $D$ satisfies $\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2$-DP.\end{theorem} There exist advanced composition theorems that give tighter
bounds on privacy loss, but we
use sequential composition as defined above for our paper.
